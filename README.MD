Data structures & Algorithms
============================

Full course implemented in Python!

I'm taking the Princeton University Coursera amazing "Algorithms I" and "Algorithms II".
During all the process I'm going to create the algorithms in Python while explaining them in the comments and docstrings (the best I can).
In this way, whenever you want to learn or review a common algorithm or data structure, I can help you can use my notes and examples :)

Given a set of unions:

union(0,2)
union(1,4)
union(3,5)

Are two objects connected?

- We will first of all identify each item as a number

Connections:
- Reflexive: P is connected to P
- Symmetric: P is connected to q and q is connected to p
- Transitive: p is connected to q, q to r, r to p

Connected components: Maximal set of objects mutually connected

{0} {1, 4, 5} {2, 3, 6, 7}

Find query: Check if two objects in the same component

Union command: Replace componentes containing two objects with their union
{1, 4, 5} {3, 6} -> {1, 4, 5, 3, 6}
